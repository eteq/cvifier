# cvifier: the CV transmogrifier

`cvifier` is a tool to keep formats of your Curriculum Vitae (CV) in sync. 
Many academics have a CV on their web site and a PDF version for use with various applications, and in can be a pain to keep those in sync with each other.  
`cvifier` is an attempt to get around that problem.
Currently, it is particular suited for astrophysics/astronomy, as that's what I do, but it should be reasonably adaptable to other disciplines.
